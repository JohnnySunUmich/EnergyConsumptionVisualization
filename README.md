# Electricity Consumption Visualization App

## Introduction

This React-based web application provides a comprehensive visualization of electricity consumption and outage data across various regions in the USA. With a suite of interactive graphs including Pie Charts, Bar Graphs, Line Graphs, and Tree Maps, users can gain deep insights into regional electricity consumption patterns, renewable energy percentages, and outage times across different states and regions.

## Features

The application is equipped with the following features, each offering a different perspective on the data:

- **Quarterly Electricity Consumption Pie Chart**: This chart provides a visual representation of electricity consumption on a quarterly basis.
- **Monthly Electricity Consumption Bar Graph**: Here users can delve into monthly consumption data, identifying patterns and trends over time.
- **State-wise Electricity Consumption Line Graph**: This graph plots the electricity consumption data of selected states over a period, with an interactive feature allowing users to zoom in and out for detailed view.
- **Region-wise Outage Time Tree Map**: This tree map gives insights into the total outage time and other relevant metrics, segregated by regions in the USA.
